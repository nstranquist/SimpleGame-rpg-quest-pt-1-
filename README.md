## "Simple Game"   [Live HERE](branson-cant-doit.surge.sh)
A simple game I made using html5 canvas, css, javascript.  
Later I added some extra touches to so that my friend would be defeated.

However, it was he who defeated the game (rather swiftly).

I wouldn't be surprised if there were a sequel.
